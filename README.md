# Modernisation of Fault Detection for Diagnosis Routines in Elevators using ESP32 MCU and Blynk Server




## Overview
Maintenance of elevators has become critical in ensuring continued operation by preventing 
excessive wear and breakdown. Maintenance greatly affects elevator downtime and uptime, hence 
the need for modernising elevator maintenance to stay abreast of other competitors. This project 
focuses on the modernisation of maintenance in elevator systems to reduce breakdowns through 
scheduled maintenance via remote condition monitoring for fault detection using the Internet of 
Things (IoT) technology.
## Methodology
Elevators are generally susceptible to high downtime during a breakdown of the system. This is 
firstly due to absence of an operator during its operation as most elevators are not manned during 
operation.
Hence, this project optimises the maintenance routine from scheduled maintenance to remote 
monitoring for fault detection and notification in order to reduce the downtime in the system. This 
is realised by installing a remote monitoring device on the elevator facility to monitor the condition 
and the fault signals on the elevator.

"Fault detection and prediction (FDP) schemes currently used are either one of the following; databased or model based as indicated in Figure 3.1. The data-based approach adopts a real-time data monitoring technique which collects the data on machine condition, analyses and predicts the current machine condition."

This research however adopts a data-based approach for fault detection for diagnosis on machines. The parameters which indicate a signal for maintenance are monitored by installation of some intelligent devices for remote data monitoring and fault notification. The data from the machine is monitored, collected, and analysed for fault detection and fault notification is sent at every deviation from the normal conditions of the parameters.

This research also adopts a Process History Based (PHB) approach for data analysis which analyses the data using a statistical approach of data comparison against a set value (severity limits). Figure 3.2 is a graphic illustration and representation of the idea of the research work.

Parameters which are critical to the condition of the elevator system was monitored. The sensors were installed on the spatial domain of the machine being used as a case study and connected to the configured Internet of Things device. The data was monitored, recorded and saved through cloud computing so that it could be accessed remotely at any location in the world. This was achieved through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud server programming.
